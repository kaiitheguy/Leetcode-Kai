Hi,

My name is Kai. I am currently the senoir associate software engineer in Capital One. 
I am now in charge of builing the posted transaction data pipeline in Capital One. 
The pipeline is composed of wathcer lamdba, invoker lambda, preprocessor, 
transformer and other components. We use Java and the pipeline is built in AWS with 
Lambda triggering Step Functions and EMR to process data. I implemented the preprocessor 
and it is running in production now. I am now implementing the transformer. 

I am also pusuing Master of Project Management in 
Northwestern University becasue I want to improve my leadership skills.
I had my Bachelor Degree of Computer Science in UC San Diego and I previously worked in Amazon.
My previous work is a combination of frontend and backend. Like building websites with React JS
and APIs with Python to performing Data Loading. 

I always want to join Google.
